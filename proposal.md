# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

MTS, Match The Symbols -----A matchmaker game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A matchmaking game where the player have to match two of the same symbols to win.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For my project, I am planning on creating a matchmaking game in either IDLE or Pygame. What my software would do is start off with empty boxes/tiles and there are hidden symbols in every tile. The player would have to click two tiles to see if they have the matching symbols. If the player has two of the matching symbols, they win. If they don't, they lose. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

To make sure that game starts up; whereas, you could see the empty tiles/boxes and the title to let you know that I did something. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think that I could accomplish making a tile turn over to display a symbol. Might be the hardest thing for me.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this final project is to have the full game running where the player is able to pick the matching symbols to win or lose. Hopefully with no errors. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to start watching videos and reading tutorials on how to code the Matchmaker game; furthermore, learning how to put my twist to the game. I will need to learn how to use the button widget in python because buttons will be used throughout the game in order to play. Also, I will have to get more familiar with the root() commands because it is the code that bridges the layout for the game. I know myself, and I know that I will get stuck building the game, so the usage of the Runestone textbook would help as a refresher.
